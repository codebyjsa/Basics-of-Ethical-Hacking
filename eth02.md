This documentation refers to installing Kali Linux in **Windows only**.

>Prerequisites: A pendrive with storage more than or equal to 32 GB

Go to [Kali Official Website](https://www.kali.org/) and click **Download**

Until then go to the web browser and search for **Rufus** or go to the [Official Site of Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/).

Scroll download to **Download** and click to *rufus-4.5.exe* under the link section or just download the latest version of the Rufus.

After it is installed, insert your pendrive in USB port of your PC, then click to the installer and then a dialog box will open and then click *Run*.
